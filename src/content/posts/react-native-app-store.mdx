# From Idea to Play Store: Building '오늘 뭐 먹지' App

Ever had that daily dilemma of "what should I eat today?" That question sparked the creation of my first published mobile app. Here's the complete journey from initial idea to 100+ downloads on Google Play Store.

## The Idea 💡

The concept was simple: **help people discover nearby restaurants through randomization**. Instead of endless scrolling through restaurant lists, users set their preferences (distance, category) and get random recommendations.

Simple, right? Well, the implementation had some interesting challenges.

## Tech Stack & Architecture

```typescript
const appStack = {
  framework: "React Native + Expo SDK 53",
  language: "TypeScript",
  styling: "NativeWind + clsx",
  maps: "Kakao Maps API + Places API",
  location: "Expo Location",
  webview: "react-native-webview",
  monetization: "Google Ads",
};
```

## Key Features

### 🎯 Smart Location-Based Search

- Current location detection with 50m-5km radius settings
- Category filtering (restaurants, cafes, bars)
- Intelligent random selection algorithm

### 🗺️ Integrated Map Experience

- Kakao Map integration for location visualization
- One-tap navigation to Naver Maps or Kakao Map
- Restaurant details and reviews

### 📱 Native Mobile Experience

- Smooth animations and gestures
- Offline capability for viewed restaurants
- Social sharing functionality

### 💰 Monetization Strategy

- Google Ads integration
- Non-intrusive banner and interstitial ads

## The Technical Challenges

### Challenge #1: Kakao API Limitations

The biggest technical hurdle was Kakao's API limit of 45 search results per query. For larger search radii, this meant users might miss great nearby options.

**Problem**: User sets 3km radius → Only gets 45 restaurants max → Missing potentially better options

**Solution**: Implemented multi-zone search strategy

```typescript
// Multi-zone search for areas > 2km
const performMultiZoneSearch = async (center: Location, radius: number) => {
  if (radius <= 2000) {
    return performSingleSearch(center, radius);
  }

  // Divide search area into 4 quadrants
  const quadrants = [
    { lat: center.lat + offset, lng: center.lng + offset }, // NE
    { lat: center.lat + offset, lng: center.lng - offset }, // NW
    { lat: center.lat - offset, lng: center.lng + offset }, // SE
    { lat: center.lat - offset, lng: center.lng - offset }, // SW
  ];

  const allResults = await Promise.all(
    quadrants.map((point) => performSingleSearch(point, radius / 2))
  );

  // Remove duplicates and sort by distance
  return removeDuplicatesAndSort(allResults.flat(), center);
};
```

This increased the effective search pool from 45 to up to 225 restaurants.

### Challenge #2: WebView Location Services

Using Kakao Maps in React Native WebView presented an unexpected challenge - location services didn't work by default.

```typescript
// The fix: Setting proper baseUrl for WebView
const MapWebView = () => {
  return (
    <WebView
      source={{
        uri: kakaoMapUrl,
        baseUrl: 'https://map.kakao.com' // This was crucial!
      }}
      geolocationEnabled={true}
      allowsInlineMediaPlayback={true}
      // Other props...
    />
  );
};
```

### Challenge #3: Expo Updates Implementation

Wanted to push updates without going through app store review process, but needed to notify users about updates.

```typescript
// Custom update check with user notification
export const useAppUpdates = () => {
  const [updateAvailable, setUpdateAvailable] = useState(false);

  useEffect(() => {
    checkForUpdates();
  }, []);

  const checkForUpdates = async () => {
    try {
      const update = await Updates.checkForUpdateAsync();

      if (update.isAvailable) {
        setUpdateAvailable(true);
        showUpdateModal();
      }
    } catch (error) {
      console.log("Update check failed:", error);
    }
  };

  const applyUpdate = async () => {
    await Updates.fetchUpdateAsync();
    await Updates.reloadAsync();
  };

  return { updateAvailable, applyUpdate };
};
```

## The Design Philosophy

### Minimalist Interface

Following the principle of "less is more", the app has just three main screens:

1. **Home**: Set preferences and get recommendation
2. **Map**: View location and navigate
3. **History**: See previously recommended places

### Performance-First Approach

- **Fast startup**: < 2 seconds from tap to usable
- **Smooth animations**: 60fps throughout the app
- **Efficient API usage**: Smart caching and batching

## Development Process

### 1. MVP Development (2 weeks)

- Basic location detection
- Simple Kakao API integration
- Minimal UI with core functionality

### 2. Feature Enhancement (3 weeks)

- Multi-zone search algorithm
- Map integration
- Sharing functionality
- History tracking

### 3. Polish & Testing (2 weeks)

- Performance optimization
- Google Ads integration
- Edge case handling
- Icon and splash screen design

### 4. Store Submission (1 week)

- Google Play Console setup
- Screenshots and store listing
- Privacy policy and terms
- Beta testing with friends

## Play Store Success Metrics

After 3 months on the store:

| Metric              | Value       |
| ------------------- | ----------- |
| **Downloads**       | 100+        |
| **Rating**          | 4.2/5       |
| **Retention**       | 23% (Day 7) |
| **Crash-free Rate** | 99.1%       |
| **Average Session** | 2.3 minutes |

## Monetization Results

Google Ads integration yielded modest but encouraging results:

- **Monthly Revenue**: ~$15-25
- **eCPM**: $2.30 average
- **Fill Rate**: 87%

Not enough to quit my day job, but proof that mobile monetization works!

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Start Simple, Iterate Fast

The MVP took 2 weeks to build and gave immediate user feedback. Don't over-engineer the first version.

### 2. API Limitations Spark Innovation

The Kakao API limit forced me to create a better search algorithm. Constraints breed creativity.

### 3. App Store Optimization Matters

Screenshots, keywords, and descriptions significantly impact discoverability.

### 4. User Feedback Is Gold

The highest-rated feature (sharing) came from user suggestions, not my original plan.

### 5. Performance > Features

Users prefer a fast app with fewer features over a slow app with many features.

## What's Next?

Currently working on Version 2.0:

- **AI-powered recommendations** based on user preferences
- **Social features** for sharing favorite spots with friends
- **Review integration** to show ratings directly in app
- **iOS version** to reach broader audience

## Technical Deep-Dive: Random Selection Algorithm

The core of the app is smart randomization. Can't just use `Math.random()` - need to consider distance, ratings, and user preferences:

```typescript
interface WeightedSelection {
  restaurant: Restaurant;
  weight: number;
}

const calculateWeight = (restaurant: Restaurant, userLocation: Location) => {
  const distanceWeight = Math.max(0, 1 - restaurant.distance / MAX_DISTANCE);
  const ratingWeight = restaurant.rating / 5;
  const categoryWeight = userPreferences.includes(restaurant.category)
    ? 1.2
    : 1;

  return distanceWeight * 0.4 + ratingWeight * 0.4 + categoryWeight * 0.2;
};

const selectRandomRestaurant = (restaurants: Restaurant[]): Restaurant => {
  const weightedOptions: WeightedSelection[] = restaurants.map(
    (restaurant) => ({
      restaurant,
      weight: calculateWeight(restaurant, userLocation),
    })
  );

  const totalWeight = weightedOptions.reduce(
    (sum, option) => sum + option.weight,
    0
  );
  let randomValue = Math.random() * totalWeight;

  for (const option of weightedOptions) {
    randomValue -= option.weight;
    if (randomValue <= 0) {
      return option.restaurant;
    }
  }

  return weightedOptions[0].restaurant; // Fallback
};
```

## Conclusion

Building and shipping '오늘 뭐 먹지' taught me that **execution matters more than the idea**. The concept was simple, but the devil was in the details - API limitations, performance optimization, user experience design, and store optimization.

The app continues to help people discover great local food, and seeing those 100+ downloads and positive reviews never gets old.

**Sometimes the best projects come from solving your own daily problems.**
